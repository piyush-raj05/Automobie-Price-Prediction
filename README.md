<h1> CAB RIDE PRICE PREDICTION </h1>
A machine learning model that learns about the cost vs attributes of Cabs featured in the market, and considers several factors such as distance, time, and even ride luxury to predict the price for the cab ride according to the market margins. Nothing more or less!
<h4> In this model I have done price analysis for two different cab companies: Uber and LYFT; I have also made a comparision for both of them </h4>
<h3> Attributes considered: </h3>
- Cab brand
- Company royalty
- Driver fees
- Car type (sedan/hatchback/SUV/luxury)
- Car condition
- Car mileage vs fuel consumption
- Distance covered
- Time taken
- Wait time
- Wear and tear cost (maintenance)
- Shared/ Not shared
- Terrain of the path (Highways cost less whereas Rocky terrains require more time and required more shocker maintenance)
- Competition margin
